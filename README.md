# C3AM
Closed Convenient Cohesive Authentication Mechanism

C3AM is a combination of Passwordless, MFA
and Token-based authentication to provide a
SSO impregnable authentication mechanism. The proposed
framework follows a flow which will authenticate the users
in a closed manner while providing ample user convenience.
The system involves very little complexity and can be easily
integrated into other cloud-based solutions at very less mone-
tary charges. The authentication schema deployed as a content
delivery network could facilitate the web applications with better
security and enhanced usability based authentication software.
The architecture can highly prevent the attacks targeted on
the cloud environments by forming an inclusive platform of
encryption, encoding and hashing algorithms

SSO is provided using user signature verification which is built using deep learning.
The implementation for the same can be found in this [link](https://github.com/Thejineaswar/Single-Sign-On-Signature-Verification)
